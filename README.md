# twitter_bot_follow_users
Tired of clicking every user to follow ? Say no more. This script will do it for you while you drink coffee.

Fill in you Twitter application keys in the script with the username of the user that followers you want to follow and start the script.

It might be that 2 seconds could be too fast so I recommend to setting it up to higher value. Also as not verified user you can follow
no more than 400 accounts per day and if you are verified then you can follow 1000 accounts per day.
